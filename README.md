### A handy application that remembers what you earn and spend. ###

*Description* of the application:
- **What will the application do?** The application will keep track of a person's income and expenditure and show them 
a summary of all the transactions in the last certain time periods while showing them their *positive or negative 
balance.*
- **Who will use it?** The application will be used by people who want to have a better control on their finances. It
can be used by university students or adults who are having trouble with their finances.
- **Why is this project of interest to you?** I feel this application can help me take control of my own finances as 
well as I have struggled in doing so in the past. As a new university student who now has to manage his own finances, 
an application that keeps track of my transactions can be of great help.
